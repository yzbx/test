LBP
===

C++ (with Python wrapper) implementation of the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) texture descriptors with Python bindings. 

A simple single-class interface, which integrates with OpenCV and FFTW3 to bring a complete and fast implementation of the popular descriptors: LBP u2, ri, riu2 &amp; hf. 

The routines for calculating these descriptors are inspired by the Matlab code of the original authors.
